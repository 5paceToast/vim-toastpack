This is basically just a collection of the vim plugins I currently use.
Will be updated as I update that stuff.

Every submodule is governed by its own licence. There's really not much to copy here, but if you have to ask, assume everything written here is licensed under the ISC license.

To use without my dotfiles repo, find a directory that's in your plugpath (~/.vim should work), then create a "pack" directory there, and clone this repository into it (so, for example, into ~/.vim/pack/vim-toastpack).
